## What is WordPress TV?

*The way I see it:*

WordPress TV is an open-source educational resource for all things related to WordPress. Videos on this site include things like:

- WordCamp Talks
- WordPress Meetup Talks
- Anything else related to the project or community

### Who cares?

As an open-source project, a lot of discussion (and healthy debate) goes on regarding the future of the platform. WPTV serves as a way to disseminate this discussion across the globe, and as an archive of the history of the WordPress project.



## How to contribute to WPTV?

The easiest places to start in WPTV are submitting and moderating.
